# ai-for-butterflies


**Overview**

AI for Butterflies is a project to extract morphological trait data from digitized museum butterfly specimens from around the world. Morphological traits like wing color and wing size can indicate how butterflies respond to environmental change. As environments change due to climate change, deforestation, and other disturbances (like hurricanes and floods), understanding how butterflies respond can help us identify species most vulnerable and most resilient.
